# Assignment 3 Notes

This framework is only to get you started; where you go from here is entirely up to you. 


## Styles

For this Assignment, you must use only one styles.css stylesheet. 

Within it, you will need multiple media queries. At 750px, your website must switch to a two-column layout; at 1160px, it will change its layout once more. 

In the largest view, your layout should become fixed-width and centred. However, background colours and background images should still span the full width of the viewport.


## Reset Code

You have been provided with 'A Modern Reset'. However, you may choose to use another CSS reset.


## Images

On Moodle, you will find an assets.zip file. Inside of it, you will find a number of SVG images. However, you will need to save and optimise all of your other images out from the provided Photoshop wireframe. 

For an unaltered version of the background image on the 'How it works' page, [head over to Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/male-constructor-drawing-draft-on-paper-roll-3760529/).


## Hints

1. Make sure that you validate your code! You **must** have complete and valid HTML before you begin styling your website.

2. After writing and validating all of your markup, start with your mobile styles. 

3. The background image on the 'How it works' page should be fixed. This will create a parallax scrolling effect. 

4. Your top-level navigation must be sticky.

5. Do not pain yourself with styling the appearance of checkboxes, radio buttons, and select elements. How they look will differ from browser to browser. 


## Further Instructions & Rubric

On Moodle, you will also find complete instructions and a marking key in .docx format.
